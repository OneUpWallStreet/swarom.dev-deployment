# Deployment Process for Swarom.dev

![Alt text](</Assets/header.png>)

There may be more advanced methods available, but the following is my current procedure.

During my last internship, I had the opportunity to explore Ansible and found it rly cool. Consequently, I decided to incorporate it into my workflow.

After making changes to the website on my local machine, in order to deploy the website, I just need to run the command `swarom.dev` in my terminal. This is an alias that simply executes the `run.sh` script.
